# hsell
I wanted to write a basic shell to learn more practical Haskell.

## What works?
* Basic built-in commands
  * cd
  * about
* Single commands with arguments

## What doesn't?
Just about anything else you'd expect your shell to do. Also, no errors are handled as of yet, so any unexpected input will crash it.

## To do list
* Input/output redirection
* Pipes
* Custom prompt
